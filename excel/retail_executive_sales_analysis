# Executive Sales Analysis – Retail Performance

## Business Context
This project presents an executive sales analysis for a large retail company operating multiple departments and stores.

The analysis was developed to support the Commercial Management team in answering three key business questions:
- Which departments are making the best use of available sales space?
- How is total sales participation distributed across departments?
- How stable is the weekly performance of each category?

## Data Overview
The dataset contains weekly sales information by store and department for the period 2010–2012.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- *Sales per square meter*: Evaluates how efficiently each department uses its available space, considering that retail space has an associated cost.
- *Sales participation by department*: Identifies which departments contribute the most to total sales, supporting decisions on investment, space allocation, and marketing efforts.
- *Sales variability (stability)*: Assesses the consistency of weekly sales to identify stable versus volatile categories.

## Analysis Focus
- Identification of high-performing departments in terms of space efficiency
- Evaluation of sales concentration across departments
- Detection of stable and volatile categories based on weekly performance

## Business Insights
- Departments with high sales per square meter demonstrate more efficient use of retail space.
- Categories with lower volatility provide greater predictability and lower operational risk.
- Highly volatile categories may require closer monitoring and specific commercial strategies.

## Business Value
This analysis supports strategic decisions related to space optimization, investment prioritization, and risk management in retail operations.
